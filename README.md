# Moodle Test Runner

This test runner was designed to be run within a CI environment to give a consistent interface for running both Behat, and PHPUnit tests for Moodle.

It can also be run locally.

## Layout

Each branch has a folder location within this repository with its own copy
of the code.

In most situations these are a symlink, but if required the script and config can be forked for a major change.

## Running locally

In order to run tests on your own machines, you need the following:

1. A checkout of Moodle that you intend to test. This should be checked out to a directory called `moodle` within a workspace directory.
2. The Docker engine installed and available as your current user
3. The `bash` shell
4. The following binaries installed:
  * `uuid`
  * `sha1sum`
  * `awk`
  * `grep`

You also need to set several environment variables, depending on your testing requirements:
